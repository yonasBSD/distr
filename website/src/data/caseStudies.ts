      'How Lerian uses Distr to power their Lifecycle Management platform for banking and financial infrastructure',
    challenge: `<a href="https://lerian.studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lerian</a> provides banking and financial infrastructure solutions that need to run in highly regulated, secure environments. Their customers in the financial sector require on-premises deployments with strict compliance, data protection, and security standards. Traditional deployment approaches created significant operational friction: manual installations, complex update procedures, error-prone rollbacks, and limited visibility into system health across multiple customer environments.

"<strong>In the financial sector, infrastructure shouldn't be a barrier to innovation,</strong>" explains Jefferson Rodrigues, Co-Founder & CTO at Lerian. "<strong>Our customers need the same speed and agility of cloud-native deployments, but within their own Kubernetes environments. We were spending too much time on operational overhead—manual deployments, coordinating updates with customer IT teams, and troubleshooting issues without proper visibility.</strong>"

The team needed a solution that would:

<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
  <li>Enable standardized, repeatable deployments across multiple customer environments</li>
  <li>Provide real-time visibility into deployment status and application health</li>
  <li>Support instant rollbacks when issues occurred</li>
  <li>Maintain complete traceability for compliance and audit requirements</li>
  <li>Reduce the operational burden on both Lerian's team and their customers' DevOps teams</li>
</ul>`,

    solution: `Lerian adopted Distr to power their Lifecycle Management platform, transforming how they distribute and manage applications in customer-controlled Kubernetes environments. By building on Distr's open-source foundation, Lerian created a comprehensive lifecycle management system that handles installations, updates, rollbacks, and monitoring—all while maintaining the security and control their financial services customers require.

<strong>Key implementation highlights:</strong>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
  <li><strong>Bring Your Own Cluster (BYOC) deployments:</strong> Customers run Lerian services in their own Kubernetes environments, meeting strict compliance requirements while leveraging standardized deployment workflows</li>
  <li><strong>Declarative deployments with versioned templates:</strong> All installations are predictable, fully traceable operations using Helm charts and OCI images, eliminating the inefficiency of manual scripts</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated monitoring dashboard:</strong> Real-time visibility into deployed versions, application health, container logs, and agent status—providing 100% visibility for internal teams without compromising customer autonomy</li>
  <li><strong>One-click rollbacks:</strong> Instant reversion to previous versions with automatic rollback in seconds, dramatically reducing Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) and eliminating long investigation windows</li>
  <li><strong>Token-protected distribution:</strong> Secure access to Helm repositories and OCI images ensures deployment integrity across all customer environments</li>
</ul>

By leveraging Distr's infrastructure, Lerian can focus on their core banking and financial services features while providing enterprise-grade deployment capabilities. Their <a href="https://docs.lerian.studio/en/lifecycle-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive documentation</a> demonstrates how customers can deploy, update, and manage Lerian services with the same ease as SaaS products—while maintaining complete control over their infrastructure.`,

    result: `Lerian's Lifecycle Management platform, powered by Distr, has transformed their operational efficiency and customer experience:

<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
  <li><strong>Smoother internal operations:</strong> Standardized deployments mean any squad can deploy new versions without opening tickets, validating features in staging with full traceability</li>
  <li><strong>Faster development cycles:</strong> Execution teams gained more control and autonomy, accelerating the entire development lifecycle</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced operational load:</strong> DevOps teams at both Lerian and their customers spend significantly less time on deployment coordination and troubleshooting</li>
  <li><strong>100% guaranteed traceability:</strong> All changes are versioned and visually organized, bringing governance to operations and improving collaboration across engineering, product, and ops teams</li>
  <li><strong>Elimination of deployment risks:</strong> Automatic rollback capabilities reduce recovery time from hours or days to seconds</li>
</ul>

The solution has proven particularly valuable in the financial sector, where Lerian operates. Banking, messaging, and latency-sensitive services require precision, control, and efficiency in managing distributed applications. By adopting Distr, Lerian ensures infrastructure is no longer a barrier to innovation—instead, it's an enabler.

Today, Lerian's customers benefit from the transparency, control, and collaboration that comes with open-source solutions, aligned with Lerian's philosophy of building trustworthy financial infrastructure.

      'How Sophris.ai uses Distr to streamline on-premises software distribution',
    challenge: `<a href="https://www.sophris.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophris</a> uses AI to automate error detection in circuit board schematics. Their platform automates what traditionally is a highly manual and error-prone process of verifying hundreds of intricate components against complex data sheets.

Initially, Sophris deployed their software directly onto virtual machines within customer environments, which quickly proved challenging. Deployments relied heavily on customers' internal IT teams, resulting in delays, misconfigurations, and slow iterations. Their engineering team often spent valuable hours troubleshooting simple file transfer and deployment issues. Sophris needed a smoother, more efficient deployment solution to maintain agility, guarantee customer success, and reduce reliance on slow-moving customer IT teams.

"<strong>At the start, we would send zip files directly to the customer IT team,</strong>" says Ansh Gupta, CTO at Sophris. "<strong>Often, simple mistakes, like not extracting a file correctly, caused significant deployment delays, draining our resources and affecting our speed. We needed a better way.</strong>"`,

    solution: `After evaluating multiple deployment solutions, Sophris chose Glasskube's Distr platform. Distr provided a straightforward yet powerful alternative, simplifying on-premises software distribution through an intuitive Docker Compose-based approach.

"<strong>We initially considered other solutions but found them overly complex and cost-prohibitive for our stage,</strong>" Gupta explained. "<strong>Distr was simple, intuitive, and exactly what we needed.</strong>"

With Distr, Sophris quickly standarized their deployment workflow. Instead of manual file transfers and troubleshooting deployment scripts, their engineers could now deploy software updates with a few clicks. Updates became significantly faster, enabling Sophris to iterate at a speed previously hard to achieve.

"<strong>Distr eliminated nearly all deployment headaches. Updates that used to take days now take minutes,</strong>" Gupta added. "<strong>This was especially crucial when we have limited access to client infrastructure.</strong>"`,

    result: `Distr significantly reduced Sophris's deployment time, enabling them to rapidly iterate and deliver continuous improvements to their clients. Sophris went from tedious, manual deployments dependent on external IT teams to seamless, self-managed updates.

By choosing Distr, Sophris improved their on-premises distribution experience, simplified updates, and freed up valuable engineering time, allowing them to focus on innovating and enhancing their core offering.`,
