## Self-hosting

In case you get stuck, have questions, or need help, we're happy to support you,

### Docker

The Distr Hub is distributed as a Docker image via ghcr.io.
Check out [`deploy/docker`](deploy/docker) for our example deployment using Docker Compose.
To get started quickly, do the following:

```shell
mkdir distr && cd distr && curl -fsSL https://github.com/distr-sh/distr/releases/latest/download/deploy-docker.tar.bz2 | tar -jx
# make necessary changes to the .env file
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes

Distr is also available as a Helm chart distributed via ghcr.io.
Check out [`deploy/charts/distr`](deploy/charts/distr) for our Helm Chart source code.
To install Distr in Kubernetes, simply run:

```shell
helm upgrade --install --wait --namespace distr --create-namespace \
  distr oci://ghcr.io/distr-sh/charts/distr \
  --set postgresql.enabled=true --set rustfs.enabled=true
```

For a quick testing setup, you don't have to modify the values.
However, if you intend to use distr in production, please revisit all available configuration values and adapt them accordingly.
You can find them in the reference [values.yaml](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/distr/distr?modal=values) file.

Using Distr agents on macOS? Follow the [guide](https://distr.sh/docs/guides/distr-on-macos/) to get started.

### Building from source

To build Distr Hub from source we recommend that you use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to install all required dependencies, but you don't have to.

All dependency versions and build tasks can be found in the [`mise.toml`](./mise.toml) file, for example:

```shell
# Build the control plane
mise run build:hub
# Build all docker images
mise run "docker-build:**"
```

## Distr Integrations

Distr offers several ways to integrate with your existing tools and workflows.

### Distr API

Distr provides a comprehensive REST API that allows you to manage deployments, artifacts, agents, licenses, and more programmatically.
The full API reference is available at https://app.distr.sh/docs.

For further details on authentication and usage, see https://distr.sh/docs/integrations/api/.

### Distr SDK

Interact with Distr directly from your application code using our first-party SDK.
The Distr SDK is currently available for JavaScript only, but more languages and frameworks are on the roadmap.
Let us know what you would like to see!

You can install the Distr SDK for JavaScript from [npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/):

```shell
npm install --save @distr-sh/distr-sdk
```

The full SDK documentation is at https://distr.sh/docs/integrations/sdk/
